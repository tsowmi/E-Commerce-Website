It is an E-commerce website (still under build) . The frontend has been created using ReactJS. Several concepts of ReactJS hae been implemented in it. The sites contains a authentication feature enabled using "bcrypt" provided by NodeJS. Database has been hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

Whenever a user creates a new account by clicking sign-up link on the navbar, the details entered are stored in the database along with the password. But the password is stored in an encrypted form that cannot be decoded easily due to "bcrypt" encryption.
